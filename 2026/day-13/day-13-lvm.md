## Day 13 – LVM with AWS EBS (Hands-on)

Today I practiced **Logical Volume Management (LVM)** using multiple AWS EBS volumes on an EC2 instance.

### What I learned
- Difference between Physical Volume, Volume Group, and Logical Volume
- How AWS EBS works as block storage for EC2
- Creating and managing LVM for dynamic storage
- Extending Logical Volume without data loss

### Hands-on tasks
- Created and attached multiple EBS volumes
- Initialized Physical Volumes using `pvcreate`
- Created Volume Group and Logical Volume
- Formatted and mounted LVM
- Extended Logical Volume and verified changes

This practice helped me understand **real-world storage management** used in production systems.
